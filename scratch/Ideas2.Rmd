# Load packages

I will load a bunch of packages including *ggraph* to ilustrate the network, in particular the Phillips Problem.

```{r}
library(dispRsal)
library(kableExtra)
library(gdistance)
library(ggraph)
library(igraph)
library(lpSolve)
library(magrittr)
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)
```


# The Phillips problem

This problem starts with a toy model of a species. We have modeled the distribution of that species and we have projected that distribution through 2 different time-slices T0 and T1, this is conceptualized by the following rasterstack called *Phillips*, as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:PhilDist)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
a <- raster(nrows= 7, ncols = 1, vals= c(0,1,0,0,1,1,1), res = 1, xmn=-0.5, xmx = 0.5, ymn = -4, ymx = 3)

b <- raster(nrows= 7, ncols = 1, vals= c(1, 0, 1,1,0,0,1), res = 1, xmn=-0.5, xmx = 0.5, ymn = -4, ymx = 3)

Phillips <- stack(a,b)
names(Phillips) <- c("T0", "T1")
```

```{r PhilDist, fig.cap= "Predicted distribution of a species for two time slices, green means the species is predicted to be present, and grey that the species is predicted to be absent"}
plot(Phillips)
```


Fot that same area we have a costlayer (*PhilCost*), we but the two middle cells are unavailable for the species, because there is an obstacle there (eg: a city or a glaciar) as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:Cost)


```{r Cost, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Raster with the cost of buying each cell, black cells are unavailable cells"}
PhilCost <- raster(nrows= 7, ncols = 1, vals= c(0.5, 1, 0.5,NA,NA,0.25,0.25), res = 1, xmn=-0.5, xmx = 0.5, ymn = -4, ymx = 3)
plot(PhilCost, colNA = "black")
```


The idea is to create a solution where the species has always at least two cells (*nchains*) available at each time-slice, but those cells have to be within reach for the species between time-slices. Let's say for example that for this species, the distance the species can travel is 111 km between time-slice 0 to time-slice 1, in this case the species would only be able to move to one adyacent cell between time-slices, this will be defined by the following variables:


```{r}
layers_habitat = Phillips
layer_cost = PhilCost
Dist = 111000
nchains = 2
```


# Step 1

First we eliminate the NA sites created by the unavailable areas shown in figure \@ref(fig:Cost)

```{r}
layers_habitat <- layers_habitat * !is.na(layer_cost)
```

This will modify the raster shown in figure 1 \@ref(fig:PhilDist) into the one we see in figure \@ref(fig:ModHab), notice that we lost 2 cells that use to be available when we first looked at the data.

```{r}
layers_habitat <- layers_habitat * !is.na(layer_cost)
```

```{r ModHab, fig.cap="Habitat layers modified so that we take out the non available values", echo = FALSE}
plot(layers_habitat)
```

Then we create a data frame of all the nodes, as we see in table \@ref(tab:A), a new *Cell_id* was generated that is unique to every node in each time-slice, but the raster_id was kept in order to be able to get the results back to the raster.

```{r}
df_habitat <- map_dfr(
  layers_habitat = layers_habitat,
  .x = 1:nlayers(layers_habitat),
  .f = ~layers_habitat[[.x]] %>%
    values() %>%
    tibble(habitat = .) %>%
    transmute(
      cell_id = row_number(),
      time = .x,
      habitat = habitat)) %>%
  # give the same cell in different time slices different IDs
  mutate(raster_id = cell_id, cell_id = cell_id + max(cell_id) * time)
```


```{r A, echo = FALSE}
kable(df_habitat, "latex", booktabs = T, row.names = F, caption = "Nodes with a new cell id that is unique for every time slice, the raster id is also kept so that we can get the results back to the raster") %>% kable_styling(latex_options =  c('striped', 'hold_position'))
```


# Generate a DF that keeps the ID of the raster cell and the new cell ID

In order to be able to compare the cell_id with raster_id in further tables a table was created with this use in mind, this is seen in table \@ref(tab:IDs):

```{r}
df_IDs <- df_habitat %>% rename(node_to = cell_id) %>% dplyr::select(node_to, raster_id)
```

```{r IDs, echo = FALSE}
kable(df_IDs,"latex", booktabs = T, row.names = F, caption = "Table of cell ID and Raster ID equivalencies") %>% kable_styling(latex_options = c('striped', 'hold_position'))
```

### Generate a DF with the costs of each cell

Using the cost layer seen in figure \@ref(fig:Cost) we generate a table with the cost of each node as seen in table table \@ref(tab:CostTable), this could be made smaller by only using the values of each cell and then using \@ref(tab:IDs) to reference the cost

```{r}
df_cost <- layer_cost %>%
  values() %>%
  tibble(cost = .) %>%
  mutate(cell_id = row_number())
df_cost <- map_dfr(
  df_cost = df_cost,
  .x = 1:nlayers(layers_habitat),
  .f = ~df_cost %>%
    transmute(
      cell_id = cell_id + max(cell_id) * .x,
      edge_cost = cost))
```

```{r CostTable, echo = FALSE}
kable(df_cost,"latex", booktabs = T, row.names = F, caption = "Cost of every node") %>% kable_styling(latex_options = c('striped', 'hold_position'))
```

# Getting the distances between variables

For that we use the function `edge_distance_limit` this will give use table \@ref(tab:cons), in which we have the pair of nodes and the distance between them in thre raster, this has already filtered out any distances greater than `Dist`

```{r}
connections <- edge_distance_limit(layer_cost = PhilCost, layers_habitat = Phillips, Dist = Dist)
```

```{r cons, echo = FALSE}
kable(connections,"latex", booktabs = T, row.names = F, caption = "Edgelist of pairs of nodes among times including distance in meters") %>% kable_styling(latex_options = c('striped', 'hold_position'))
```

# get all valid edge connections,

In this step we do 3 different processes

First we filter only the pairs of nodes that hava a capacity of one:

```{r}
edges_timesteps <- map_dfr(
  df_habitat = df_habitat,
  .x = 2:nlayers(layers_habitat),
  .f = ~expand_grid(
    node_from = df_habitat %>%
      filter(time == .x - 1 & habitat == 1) %>%
      pull(cell_id),
    node_to = df_habitat %>%
      filter(time == .x & habitat == 1) %>%
      pull(cell_id),
    timeslice_to = .x)) %>% mutate(
      edge_id = row_number(),
      edge_capacity = 1,
      edge_cost = NA)
```


Then we add the cost by adding the costs of both nodes that participate in the edge:

```{r}
for(i in 1:nrow(edges_timesteps)){
  #Check if the raster ID is equal in node_to and node_from
  if(df_IDs$raster_id[df_IDs$node_to == edges_timesteps[i,]$node_to] == df_IDs$raster_id[df_IDs$node_to == edges_timesteps[i,]$node_from]){
    ## If that is the case just add the cost once
    edges_timesteps$edge_cost[i] <- df_cost$edge_cost[df_cost$cell_id == edges_timesteps[i,]$node_from]
  }
  #Check if the raster ID is Different in node_to and node_from
  if(df_IDs$raster_id[df_IDs$node_to == edges_timesteps[i,]$node_to] != df_IDs$raster_id[df_IDs$node_to == edges_timesteps[i,]$node_from]){
    ## If that is the case just add the cost twice
    edges_timesteps$edge_cost[i] <- df_cost$edge_cost[df_cost$cell_id == edges_timesteps[i,]$node_from] + df_cost$edge_cost[df_cost$cell_id == edges_timesteps[i,]$node_to]
  }
}
```

And finally, we filter those nodes according to the ones that are at distances permited by `Dist` using table \@ref(tab:cons), we finally get table \@ref(tab:edgesvalid).

```{r}
edges_timesteps <- left_join(edges_timesteps, connections) %>% dplyr::filter(!is.na(dist)) %>% dplyr::select(-dist)
```


```{r edgesvalid, echo = FALSE}
kable(edges_timesteps,"latex", booktabs = T, row.names = F, caption = "Edgelist of pairs of nodes where habitat is 1 and distance is bellow 11,000") %>% kable_styling(latex_options = c('striped', 'hold_position'))
```


# add source and target edges


```{r}
edges_source <- tibble(
  # lowest ids available
  # FIXME: temp workaround
  edge_id = min(edges_timesteps[['edge_id']]),
  node_from = 0,
  # find all timeslice 1 nodes
  node_to = edges_timesteps %>%
    filter(timeslice_to == 2) %>%
    pull(node_from) %>%
    unique(),
  timeslice_to = 1,
  edge_capacity = nchains,
  edge_cost = 1) %>%
  # unique ids!
  mutate(edge_id = edge_id - row_number())

edges_target <- tibble(
  # FIXME: temp workaround
  edge_id = max(edges_timesteps[['edge_id']]),
  node_from = edges_timesteps %>%
    filter(timeslice_to == max(edges_timesteps[['timeslice_to']])) %>%
    pull(node_to) %>%
    unique(),
  node_to = max(edges_timesteps[['node_to']]) + 1,
  timeslice_to = max(edges_timesteps[['timeslice_to']]) + 1,
  edge_capacity = nchains,
  edge_cost = 1) %>%
  # unique ids!
  mutate(edge_id = edge_id + row_number())

edges_formatted <- edges_timesteps %>%
  bind_rows(edges_source, edges_target) %>%
  arrange(edge_id)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(edges_formatted,"latex", booktabs = T, caption = "Edgelist of pairs of nodes where habitat is 1 and distance is bellow 11,000, including source and target") %>% kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")
```

# sovler -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# create constraints matrix

```{r}
constraints_matrix <- create_constraints_matrix(
  edges = edges_formatted,
  total_flow = nchains)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(constraints_matrix,"latex", booktabs = T, row.names = F, caption = "Constraints matrix")
```

# run lpSolve to find best solution

```{r}
solution <- lp(
  direction = 'min',
  objective.in = edges_formatted[['edge_cost']],
  const.mat = constraints_matrix[['lhs']],
  const.dir = constraints_matrix[['dir']],
  const.rhs = constraints_matrix[['rhs']])
```






# visualize --------------------------------------------------------------------
# combine with edge information

```{r}
edges_solved <- bind_cols(edges_formatted, solution = solution[['solution']]) %>% left_join(df_IDs) %>% dplyr::filter(solution != 0)


TestStack <- list()


for(i in 1:nlayers(layers_habitat)){
  Test<- layer_cost
  values(Test) <- 0
  values(Test)[edges_solved %>% dplyr::filter(timeslice_to == (i)) %>% pull(raster_id) %>%  unique()] <- edges_solved %>% dplyr::filter(timeslice_to == (i)) %>% group_by(raster_id) %>% summarise(flow = sum(solution))  %>% pull(flow)
  TestStack[[i]] <- Test
}

TestStack <- do.call("stack", TestStack)

names(TestStack) <- paste0("T", 1:nlayers(TestStack))

```



```{r Solution, echo = FALSE}
kable(edges_solved,"latex", booktabs = T, row.names = F, caption = "Solution") %>% kable_styling(latex_options = c('striped', 'hold_position'))
```

```{r, fig.cap="Time slice by time slice solution", echo=FALSE}

```{r, fig.cap="Global solution", echo=FALSE}
plot(max(TestStack))
```
